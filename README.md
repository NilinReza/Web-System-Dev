# Web Systems Development Project

## Overview

This repository contains a web development project built as part of my **Web Systems Development** course. The project is in **iterative development**, meaning that it will evolve over time as new technologies and features are introduced. Each iteration builds on the previous one, gradually incorporating more advanced techniques and technologies to enhance both functionality and user experience.

Currently, the project includes an **"About Me"** page that provides an introduction to my background and skills. Over time, it will expand to include sections where I showcase my **previous projects**, allowing the website to serve as an **online portfolio** and an extension of my resume.
